The Test Anything Protocol [1] is a simple protocol for expressing
the results of unit tests. This is a gforth implementation of a
TAP producer.

Currently I'm using it with Perl's prove command. Given a test script
like this:

    #! /usr/local/bin/gforth

    require ../lib/test-more.fs

    2 plan

    diag" Testing\n"

    \ Test dup. Probably works.

    {sp

    1 dup =ok" dup works" ?sp

    }sp

    bye

And assuming a recent version of Perl is installed you can:

    $ prove t/dup.fs

and get results like this:

    t/dup....# Testing
    t/dup....ok                                                                  
    All tests successful.
    Files=1, Tests=2,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.01 cusr +  0.02 csys =  0.03 CPU)

or to see individual results:

    $ prove -v t/dup.fs
    t/dup....# Testing
    1..2
    ok 1 dup works
    ok 2 stack balanced
    ok
    All tests successful.
    Files=1, Tests=2,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.01 cusr +  0.02 csys =  0.03 CPU)

This release should be considered alpha. If you find it useful please let me know.
